# CSCI-230-Data-Structures-2
This repository stores a few of my projects from my class CSCI 230 - Data Structures 2.
I took this course at Mt. San Antonio College

There are 4 Projects in this repository. 

- One project utilizes Hashing Scheme data structures. Reads in a text file and then imports the data onto a map. The hashing schemes used are: 
  - Chain Hashing
  - Linear Probing
  - Double Hashing  
- Another project utilizes a few sorting algorithms. Sorting algorithms used are:
  - Quick Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Another project utilizes a Standard Trie data structure. Driver takes in a file input from desktop and then creates a trie with given txt file. Users are given a menu where you can insert, delete, search, and get the total words in the trie.
- Another project creates a graph and utilizes Dijkstra's to find the best flight path. Paths are taken in from a text file.


## Things I learned in this course
- Basic searching/sorting algorithms
- Hashing
- Graphs
- Advanced Tree Structures and Analysis.
